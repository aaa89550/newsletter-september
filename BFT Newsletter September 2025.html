                                    The inaugural Taiwan International Children & Youth Book Fair was held in Taichung this year, and of course, the Books from 2.0 team was there! We had the pleasure of meeting publishers and agents from around the world. We felt truly fortunate to connect with others and exchange ideas in this new space.

                                    Today we’re sharing five children’s titles that reflect the many dimensions of growing up. We hope they resonate with you as deeply as they did with us.
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Childhood is filled with questions, doubts, and quiet struggles. Whether it’s losing confidence in what you love, feeling ordinary compared to others, or simply needing someone to listen, children often look for stories that can mirror their experiences and gently guide them forward. 
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Our picture books shine a light on the emotional heart of creativity and self-discovery. <em>A-Fei, A Little Girl Who Loves Drawing</em> portrays the ups and downs of inspiration, showing how friendship and play can bring joy back to a child’s art. <em>The Little Alpaca Who Looked for Confidence</em> follows Mary, an alpaca who feels ordinary, as she searches across the world for confidence. Along the way, she discovers that her shyness and slowness carry hidden strengths of their own. Both books remind us that true encouragement is found in companionship, patience, and the courage to see ourselves differently.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Our comics explore the everyday challenges children face in school and growing up. In <em>The Secret of Forgetful School</em>, a forgetful monkey and his classmates discover that forgetting doesn’t mean failure, but a chance to learn what really matters. In <em>What’s Wrong with the Time?</em>, a slow-moving fox turns his pace into a strength, protecting time itself with his patience and care. And in <em>Take Me Home</em>, handmade dolls quietly accompany children and teenagers through loneliness, change, and resilience—becoming silent witnesses to their growth. Together, these comics transform frustrations and hidden struggles into playful, tender lessons of empathy and love.

                                    A-Fei is a little girl who draws from morning until night—even in her dreams. But one day, frustration wells up and she blurts out, “I can’t draw anything right!” Instead of reassuring her with empty words, her friends simply invite her to join in what they love: skateboarding, bug-watching, piano playing.
                                </p>
                                <p class="spaced-paragraph" style="color: #000;">
                                    Through these everyday moments, A-Fei gradually rediscovers joy, confidence, and the urge to create. This gentle, beautifully illustrated picture book captures the emotional ups and downs of creativity, showing that doubt is a natural part of the process. What guides A-Fei back is not adult advice, but the presence of friends, shared laughter, and the simple rhythms of life.
                                </p>

                                    Winner of the Hsin-Yi Picture Book Illustration Award, this work speaks to children and adults alike—anyone who has ever felt stuck, doubted themselves, or laid down their pencil in frustration. It reminds us that inspiration doesn’t always come on command, but returns naturally through companionship, trust, and joy.

                                    Mary the alpaca feels ordinary. She isn’t fast, she isn’t bold, and she often compares herself to her dazzling friends who can sing, run, and shine in their own ways. Surrounded by brilliance, Mary can’t help but see only her shortcomings.
                                </p>

                                    But when someone suggests that Mary “look for confidence,” she takes the advice literally. Her journey carries her across the world—scuba diving to the bottom of the sea and climbing the highest mountain, all at her own pace. What once seemed like weaknesses—quietness, shyness, slowness—are transformed into unique strengths, revealing her courage and determination.

                                    <em>The Little Alpaca Who Looked for Confidence</em> is a tender, encouraging picture book that reminds children (and adults as well!) that everyone has strengths waiting to be discovered. Sometimes confidence isn’t given—it’s found, step by step, in the process of trying, failing, and daring to see yourself differently.

                                   This series of children’s comics explores the everyday struggles of childhood and adolescence—forgetfulness, distraction, slowness, and the pressure to keep pace with others. With whimsy, warmth, and a touch of fantasy, the stories highlight how toys, classmates, and even magical objects can become companions who see children’s hidden struggles and help them through the challenges of growing up.

                                   In <em>The Secret of Forgetful School</em>, Wu Xiao Monkey can’t stop forgetting things—homework, bags, and more. Rumor has it that one more slip will send him to Forgetful School, a place for the most absent-minded kids. One day, his classmates begin forgetting their scissors, their erasers, even their own eyes. At this strange school, children must learn what it really means to remember. Lighthearted yet thoughtful, this story reassures young readers that being forgetful doesn’t mean being unworthy, while reminding adults to respond with empathy instead of scolding.

                                   In <em>What’s Wrong with the Time?</em>, Little Fox is nicknamed “Slowpoke” because he moves at his own unhurried pace. When he discovers a magical watch that can control time, he is suddenly tasked with protecting the world’s time itself. Through this fantastical adventure, the story reframes “slowness” as a unique rhythm rather than a flaw. It helps children understand their own pace with pride, while inviting parents to respect differences in how children perceive and live within time.
